                    <h2 class="section-heading"> don't say "I care for you" just show that you do </h2>
                    <p> At some point in time, most of us have seen our loved ones waiting for us at bus stops, railway stations or airports. They never tell us that they care for us. We have never seen them talking about that. But we know very well that
                        they do care for us, we know it because they have always shown that. Caring for someone is not something which can be defined in words. It's a quality that is expressed less in words and more in practicality. Though it's also true
                        that sometimes care can also be expressed in words depending on situations. Today we are going to see 5 really interesting ways to show our care for the ones who make our life more beautiful than we can think of. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">1) Wait for someone </h2>
                    <p></p>

                    <p>Waiting for someone is sometimes the most difficult task. We are humans and easily become impatient when we don't find someone we are expecting at right time. </p>

                    <p> If we really care about the person, It's important that we wait even if takes hours instead of minutes. we have to be committed to wait. It is easier said than done but this is the reason its one of the best methods to show that you
                        care. In today's world our impatient behaviour is one of the most common reasons for our 'not so good' relations. And to build really strong relations we really need to be more caring and we need to take the first step by showing
                        our care. If somebody makes us wait for some genuine reasons and we don't lose our patience, chances are that the same person will never ever make us wait again. People are usually our own reflection. If we'll start showing our
                        concern for people we'll receive the same from other side. Newton's third law applies well on the concept of care. </p>
                    <p> And in case for some reasons,if we have to make someone wait for us, it's usually a good advice to inform them in advance and take some flowers as a gift for their patience and kindness. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2) keep adding droplets of care </h2>
                    <p>Caring is not only about helping people when they really need it. Instead caring is a continuous practice. And to show somebody that you care, it's not always necessary to buy expensive gifts. Caring is not at all related to monetary
                        gifts. Sometimes we can show our care by doing tasks on behalf of people we care about, just for example, what if a friend has to return some books to the library and you know you're walking to the library, you can offer to do
                        his or her task. Similarly offering a colleague a ride to office by your car are some of the things that cost us nothing but they are really valuable and are usually long term investment. </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) feel good about taking initiatives </h2>
                    <p> Sometimes we don't call a friend because we fall into the trap of 'Why always me?' what we need to understand is people have different ways to show their concern. Just because somebody doesn't call doesn't mean they don't care about
                        us or they don't like us. Therefore if we ever feel like calling someone, it's good to take initiative even if we haven't talked for a while. Our initiatives will always bring a smile on someone's face. This is one of the best
                        ways to say that you're committed to a relationship and you care. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) gift things specific to a person </h2>
                    <p> If we listen carefully, people are always telling what they need, how they want their life to be, what is that they like doing the most. And this is the catch, all we have to do is listen to them carefully and without telling them
                        make a list of things which are specific to them. sometimes people like about checking online shopping sites, for such people we can visit online sites and tell them what suits them or simply sharing some links can do the trick.
                        In other cases people may like reading or cooking and we can consider offering them some books for their help. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">5) Always be ready to help </h2>
                    <p> people usually like to be helped, And their happiness multiplies when someone they love offers to help. Helping is a very kind gesture and a really powerful way to show that you care. When someone asks for your help, try to make sure
                        that you give in all you have. Things like multi-tasking will only waste your and other person't time. Instead take you time, think about if you can really help, and if you say you're available you must be 100% there for help.
                        This makes others think they're valuable to you and they mean something to you. In very simple words, when you give your 100% to a person, they automatically understand that you care for them. </p>

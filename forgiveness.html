                    <h2 class="section-heading">What the world leaders thought about forgiveness </h2>
                    <p>Before I even start writing about this important aspect of human behaviour, lets see what the great leaders of the world thought about forgiveness, here are a few of those great thoughts </p>
                    <br><b>Courageous people don’t fear forgiving, for the sake of peace </b> <i> -Nelson Mandela </i>
                    <br><b>The weak can never forgive. Forgiveness is the attribute of the strong</b> <i> -Mahatma Gandhi </i>
                    <br><b>Forgiveness is not an occasional act, it is a constant attitude.</b> <i> -Martin Luther King Jr </i>

                    <p> In today's digital world on one hand we have the whole world at our hand through our digital devices and on the other hand we feel sometimes become angry to people who sit on the desk next to us and we don't connect or shake hands
                        with them for several days. Apart from the need to discover other parts of universe for life, I think we really need to learn forgiveness to make our life beautiful on this planet. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">Forgiving means to choose peace </h2>
                    <p> Why we need to forgive? How can we think of forgiving the one who did some harm to us? Well the answer is simple. When we choose to forgive, we are choosing to be more peaceful. A small act of saying: " I forgive you" brings us utmost
                        satisfaction and peace of mind and not only this it also sends positive energy to one asking for forgiveness. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> What if we choose not to forgive !!</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes a person gets so deeply hurt by something that he feel like taking revenge on people or stop talking to people. But what happens if the person do that. By thinking of revenge or avoiding communication he constantly keep the
                        incident that made him unhappy attached to his brains. He surround himself with the negativity generated by incidents which harmed him. This really affects his life. He start developing emotions like anger and dis-satisfaction,
                        it sometimes even leads to depression. The person may even start trusting people less. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Lets face the truth !!</h2>
                    <p> Yes anybody of us could be hurt emotionally or mentally at any time. We can not control what people think about us, we don't even know how people will behave in different situations. Sometimes we try to be good to someone and in return
                        we are take wrongly. We all have heard phrases like "There is no room for goodness in this world". Well, all these things will hold true if you let them. It is true that we can't control behaviour or actions of people. But what
                        about our own actions ? What about our own thoughts. We can control our actions as well as our thoughts. We can choose to forgive people. The demand for forgiving people has never been more than this. Today is the best day to start
                        forgiving others. </p>
                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Lets start to forgive today </h2>
                    <p> What if we start to forgive, what if we start a new day today, what if start by forgiving all those who ever did any harm to us. We soon start feeling as if we are reborn, we feel being more joyful and peaceful. We start to give more
                        attention to things which matter more to us. A single act of forgiveness can completely change our life all together. We become a more positive person and our attitude towards others also improve. We start being respected more
                        as a caring and compassionate human being by our friends, family and the society. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Health benefits of forgiveness </h2>
                    <p>Forgiveness has gained a lot of scientific attention in the past few decades and many researchers around the world have dedicated their whole lives researching on what forgiveness brings to our life. </p>

                    <p>Research shows that people who easily forgive have many health benefits like: </p>
                    <br><b>Healthier Life style </b>
                    <br><b>Less problems related to blood pressure and heart</b>
                    <br><b>More positive attitude towards stress of life</b>
                    <br><b>Healthier relationships with family and society</b>

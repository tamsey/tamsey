                    <h2 class="section-heading"> Live with Courage </h2>
                    <p> Life is a tough game and unlike many other games we have only one chance. And just like many other games, in life also we can choose from different difficulty levels. We can choose to spend our life by merely existing or we can choose
                        to go the hard way and make our life full of exciting adventures by chasing our dreams. If we choose to go the hard way, we have to be very prepared for the challenges which come, they are mostly good enough to break us completely
                        if we let them do that.This article is dedicated to those who choose to live with courage. lets explore some ways to lead a courageous life, lets dare to be courageous </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading"> </h2>
                    <p> </p>



                    <p> </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2) keep adding droplets of care </h2>
                    <p>Caring is not only about helping people when they really need it. Instead caring is a continuous practice. And to show somebody that you care, it's not always necessary to buy expensive gifts. Caring is not at all related to monetary
                        gifts. Sometimes we can show our care by doing tasks on behalf of people we care about, just for example, what if a friend has to return some books to the library and you know you're walking to the library, you can offer to do
                        his or her task. Similarly offering a colleague a ride to office by your car are some of the things that cost us nothing but they are really valuable and are usually long term investment. </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) feel good about taking initiatives </h2>
                    <p> Sometimes we don't call a friend because we fall into the trap of 'Why always me?' what we need to understand is people have different ways to show their concern. Just because somebody doesn't call doesn't mean they don't care about
                        us or they don't like us. Therefore if we ever feel like calling someone, it's good to take initiative even if we haven't talked for a while. Our initiatives will always bring a smile on someone's face. This is one of the best
                        ways to say that you're committed to a relationship and you care. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) gift things specific to a person </h2>
                    <p> If we listen carefully, people are always telling what they need, how they want their life to be, what is that they like doing the most. And this is the catch, all we have to do is listen to them carefully and without telling them
                        make a list of things which are specific to them. sometimes people like about checking online shopping sites, for such people we can visit online sites and tell them what suits them or simply sharing some links can do the trick.
                        In other cases people may like reading or cooking and we can consider offering them some books for their help. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">5) Always be ready to help </h2>
                    <p> people usually like to be helped, And their happiness multiplies when someone they love offers to help. Helping is a very kind gesture and a really powerful way to show that you care. When someone asks for your help, try to make sure
                        that you give in all you have. Things like multi-tasking will only waste your and other person't time. Instead take you time, think about if you can really help, and if you say you're available you must be 100% there for help.
                        This makes others think they're valuable to you and they mean something to you. In very simple words, when you give your 100% to a person, they automatically understand that you care for them. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">We have a limited time on this earth </h2>
                    <p>Life is the biggest project ever assigned to us. Every day is a milestone towards the completion of this project. If we fail to plan each day, we may fall short of time and hence may not be able to finish our project the way we want
                        to
                    </p>
                    <p>Every day counts and therefore it becomes our responsibility that we become our own project managers and create the road map for a successful day. If we spend first 10-15 minutes of our day planning, then it can save us hours of thinking
                        and moreover we ahall be more focussed on our project </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Here's how we can create the roadmap for a successful day </h2>
                    <p>I have tried to compile five important points to keep in mind while we create a plan to live our day well. These five things remain the same irrespective of our profession or lifestyle. These are so common and so generic that they
                        apply both to the life of a school going kid and they apply equally well to the life of a project manager handling the next space exploration project. Lets dive into these 5 points </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">1) Prioritize your tasks </h2>

                    <p>I was a little confused about whether I should write this thing first or second, but after a lot of research based thought I planned to go with this point at number 1. Everyday we usually have a set of tasks to be performed. If we
                        prioritize them based on our own algorithms. It will become very easy to understand what has to be done for the day and what can be left for tomorrow or for some other time. Doing this simple step can get us out of a confused state
                        and hence we can concentrate more on what we have planned to do. When we don't have any priority of tasks in mind, we may fall out of way and end up wasting a lot of our precious time </p>

                    <p>In a more precise way, its all about prioritizing the tasks. Before we go on to step 2, we should have a list of tasks we need to perform with information on what is the degree of need.You may ask yourself: Is it OK to skip task X
                        for today or it needs to be done and so on </p>

                    <p><b>What we expect on completion of step 1</b></p>
                    <p>Simply a list of tasks to be performed for the day with a degree of need mentioned along with each task</p>
                    <table class="table table-striped">
                        <caption>Sample list of priority of tasks</caption>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>
                                <th>Task</th>
                                <th>Degree of Need or Priority out of 10</th>
                            </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Exercise</td>
                                <td>10</td>

                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Office</td>
                                <td>10</td>

                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Car wash</td>
                                <td>8</td>

                            </tr>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Museum visit</td>
                                <td>5</td>

                            </tr>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <td>Your task</td>
                                <td>priority</td>

                            </tr>
                        </tbody>
                    </table>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2) Manage your time well</h2>
                    <p>The next step is time management, we know what we need to do now is the time to decide what is the best time to do what we have planned to do. Of course we can not control when we go to office or when the bus arrives but yes we can
                        manage how much time we give to the tasks we have planned for the day. This is the step where we have to plan our 24 hours. We have to make sure we give reasonable time to all the activities and based on our skill set we can distribute
                        the time we need to perform each activity. Some may prefer evening walk over morning walk, therefore it's up to us how much and when to give time to each activity. </p>

                    <p>After these 2 simple steps we know what are the things to be done and when is the best time to do them. We also know how much time can we afford to give to each activity </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">3) Set value driven goals</h2>

                    <p>I will spend 10 hours at office is not enough. It does not make much sense to our boss if we spend 10 hours at office doing nothing much except social networking and checking our mails. What sounds more good is that I'll deliver N
                        units of work by the evening or in this much amount of time. Goals have to be driven by value not by time only. Plan what you intend to deliver only then decide what is the time needed for it to be done. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) Challenge yourself</h2>
                    <p>We love challenges. Challenges make our life more interesting and valuable. Therefore when we plan our day, it's important that we don't forget to challenge our self everyday. It's not difficult, we can start with simple challenges
                        like <br> 1) Completing the daily routine task 1 hour earlier <br> 2) Doing more exercise than previous day in same time period. <br> these type of simplistic challenges have the potential to keep us on our track</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">5) Always keep a window for self renewal</h2>
                    <p>We should make sure that while planning our day, we always keep some time for ourself or for the activities we love to perform. It could be anything from reading a blog post to dancing, painting or just about anything. The importance
                        of this is that we feel recharged and refreshed. </p>

                    <p> Following these 5 simple steps, we can create the roadmap for a successful day and hence make a successful living </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Quit the habit of making excuses </h2>
                    <p>we can spend our whole life making excuses and then a few years from now on our death bed, we'll have nothing much except for an excuse that if we were given a few more years to live we would have been able to deliver something better
                        than this. We'll have nothing much left with us. Our excuses will not bring us anything except adding salt to our sorrows. It is really important to understand that there is nothing much we can get out of excuses except for a temporary
                        ignorance from the reality. When we make excuses we usually try to ignore our own responsibility. We try to escape the battle by saying we don't have resources or time and many other things</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Be accountable for your situation </h2>
                    <p> Whatever situation we are in today is because of our own decisions and actions. We get what we work for. If we know we are not where we need to be or where we deserve to be, then the very first thing we need to learn is to take the
                        responsibility for our situation. We need to accept that we are accountable for our situation. Whether we made mistakes or took wrong actions, we have to be ready to face the reality and say that "I know I have messed up" I am
                        accountable for my mistakes and this is where our life turns towards the roads to success </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">Be willing to change your circumstances </h2>
                    <p>Being accountable for our actions automatically vanishes the fear of failure from our mind. When we start taking responsibility for our actions, we become very careful about our decisions and moreover we focus more on the process then
                        the end results. Our mission becomes more oriented towards making the best use of every moment and this only leads us towards a more focussed and purpose driven life </p>

                    <p>a change in our circumstances starts with a change in our thought patterns, be willing to change those behaviours which you know are not in your favour. </p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Be accountable and people will trust you</h2>
                    <p>Most human beings on this earth are usually very friendly and are ready to help you succeed if only they know you are the one they could trust. Its very important and necessary to win trust of others if you want them to listen to you.
                        Nobody takes a careless person much seriously. If people know you're always accountable for your actions and you rely less on circumstances and situations, chances are that people will trust you more and you'll become a valuable
                        asset </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Be willing to ask for forgiveness</h2>

                    <p>What if things go wrong ?? </p>

                    <p>Everybody on this planet knows that if we try to do something then we are vulnerable to making mistakes. And the only people who never make mistakes are the once who never try anything on their own. When mistakes are so common and
                        an inseparable part of our life, what is the problem in accepting if we have messed up something. In case something has gone wrong, its always good to accept it and ask for forgiveness. There are hardly any people who will not
                        forgive you knowing your intentions. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">The world is all yours </h2>
                    <p> When you're accountable for your mistakes, you have the full right to be accountable for all the great things that happen to you. Nobody can take away those millions emotions of happiness and positivity that surround you when you achieve
                        something great. The world is waiting to smile with you in your happiness. <br>Its only up to us when we give this world the chance to celebrate our success and celebrate our life. Be accountable and the world is all yours. </p>

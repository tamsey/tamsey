                    <h2 class="section-heading">our greatest limitation is our own opinion</h2>
                    <p>we must have heard it many times and it holds true: </p>
                    <p>Whether we think we can or we think we can't we are usually right. The greatest limitation of any human being on this earth is not money, not health, not even language, culture or gender. The greatest limitation of humans is their
                        lack of imagination. What we can imagine, we can create. Our imagination and our thoughts have the power to stimulate action. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">They imagined what seemed impossible </h2>
                    <p>People who born several decades ago have already set great examples for us to believe in the power of imagination. Wright brothers imagined flying machines and today it's no magic for us. GandhiJi thought freedom movement is possible
                        without any violence and today his principles are appreciated and adopted by many great leaders of the world. He is also considered the father of India</p>

                    <p>What leads us to great inventions is a will to keep walking when roads seem to be ending. Walking on the same old roads will lead us no where. The journey of great inventors start where the well beaten road ends. But they don't stop,
                        they keep on moving. Most of the times they don't try to discover new things what instead they look for is to discover their own self. They are simply walking to see how much they can take it. How far can they walk when they know
                        their is less chance of success. Most victories come after adversities and the real self discovery lies in pushing ourself to our limits</p>



                    <h2 class="section-heading">Limits are where we impose them</h2>
                    <p> 100 years ago, Nobody would have thought we could reach Mars. But does that mean we stopped our exploration, does that mean we stopped thinking about setting our foot on Mars, does that mean we shut down all research projects on space.
                        No we didn't. We were not sure of success but we were not willing to give up. Our limitations are usually self imposed. We think we can't speak in public because we have never done that before, and the reality is if we don't try
                        it today, we'll never be able to speak. If we don't start discovering our self we'll be left un-discovered and nobody shall be responsible for that except our own self. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Start soon, its a long journey</h2>

                    <p>discovering ourself is a journey, it's more like journey of science. We never know when we shall get new results. What's important is that we always have the urge to keep walking. Whether we meet success or failures in this journey,
                        it should never stop. The only stop to our journey towards self discovery should be our death and nothing else</p>

                    <p>when we are committed to push ourself to our limits, we learn how powerful our imagination and thoughts are. We start realizing that we can convert our mental thoughts into their physical equivalent. We start seeing our dreams becoming
                        a reality. The real magic of this world is not the one performed by magicians, instead the real magic is what we experience when we discover things we never had imagined of ourself. </p>



                    <p>We don't even know what self discovery can reveal to us. But the truth is that it takes a lot more patience and dedication then we can think of. If we see value in this journey instead of the results that it brings, we can be more
                        comfortable </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Its never too late</h2>
                    <p> Sometimes our past mistakes become one of the major hurdle to our present actions and hence it affects our future too. We fall into the trap of thinking if we failed in the past or for some reasons if we could not try in the past,
                        same things will happen now also.The truth is even if we have failed many times in the past, this is not the reason to not start again. Thomas Edison is an inspiration to the whole world, and he taught us that even failures are
                        part of discovery as they teach us how not to do things. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">flow like a river and oceans will welcome you </h2>
                    <p> Now is the best time, this moment is the best moment and there will never be an opportunity better than this to start the journey of self discovery. Lets start to walk and commit ourself to keep walking till we know we can walk more
                    </p>

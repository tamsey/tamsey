                    <h2 class="section-heading">I have a short story to share with you </h2>
                    <p>when I was in grade 7, I felt some problem in my eyes and my mother took me to the doctor. The doctor said I'll have to wear a spectacle of number 4. My mother was shocked and so was I, as a kid, I spent very less time in activities
                        like TV, phones were not even the part of the game at that time. We walked back home and life started again. I was not convinced with what doctor said and therefore I used to wear my specs less and play with them more. 1 day my
                        curiosity made me discover that if I focus lens of my spectacles on a piece of paper it would burn the paper. I was enthusiastic about this discovery and further examination brought the concept of FOCIS to my life</p>
                    <p> Later on as I started thinking about making life meaningful and productive, the concept of focus came to mind again. We humans have enormous energy just like the sun and we are also continuously emitting energy. The fact goes with
                        the human energy also, if it is not focused it will barely create any impact and on the other hand if our energy is focused on achieving a goal then anything is possible. We can achieve any imaginable and realistic goal by focusing
                        our energy </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">How can I become focused in life? </h2>
                    <p>It takes some time to focus the lens on piece of paper before it can burn the paper, it needs to be at a proper distance and orientation to work properly. Almost same is the case with humans also we need to take care of a few important
                        things if we want to be more focused in life. Here I have tried to write a few points which can help us to stay more focused. This is not a comprehensive list but a good point to start focusing on things that matter</p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">1) Define clear goals</h2>
                    <p>When you want to focus, you need to know exactly what you want to focus on. Therefore the very first step is to be very clear about what you're aiming for. Write your well defined goal in a dark bold font on a sheet of paper and stick
                        it on some wall in front of you. Make sure that it is in a line of sight with your eyes. It will keep reminding you of your purpose and will help you to walk straight to your mission avoiding any diversions or obstacles. </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">2) Do exactly one thing at a time</h2>

                    <p>When we try to cater to multiple things at the same time, we usually end up messing things. Try to avoid that and you'll have fewer distractions to tackle with. Give reasonable time to each activity of your life but at one time use
                        all your energy on a single activity. Try to do one activity in the best possible way it could be done before moving on to the next one. </p>


                    <h2 class="section-heading">3) Meditate or play for some time</h2>

                    <p>Meditation gives us relaxation and at the same time it improves our power to concentrate. Playing games also have the power to sharpen our focus. Here's are a few point about how games can be helpful: </p>
                    <p>1) In outdoor games like soccer, we always have to keep our eyes on the ball and mind on the goal </p>
                    <p>2) In indoor games like chess, all our energy is focused on the kings and their armies and we feel disconnected to the outer world </p>
                    <p>3) In mobile games these days, we find things like puzzles and brain-teasers which we can play in our free time and they are a good exercise to our focusing ability </p>




                    <h2 class="section-heading">4) Reward your concentration</h2>
                    <p> Don't expect to reach your peak state or state of extreme focus on the very first day. Go slow but be continuous. Try to define levels of concentration and try to reach a new level every day. Make sure that each new level takes your
                        focusing power to a new height. And when you add more strength to your focusing power, don't sit quite just reward yourself for making your own life focused and hence more organized and positive.</p>
